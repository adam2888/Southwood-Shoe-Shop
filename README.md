# Southwood-Shoe-Shop

This is a product page for a fictional shoe store. 

The webpage has two thumbnails of the different products available. When a thumbnail is clicked, a larger image appears.

The size, colour and quantity can all be selected via drop down menus and buttons. The order summery and final price will automatically update when changes are made.

When hovering over the heart, a button appears for the item to be added as a favourite. This is a single page website, which uses media queries to make it responsive. The CSS framework SASS is used to style the website.
