# Southwood-Shoe-Shop
A product page for a fictional shop selling shoes. 

The product page has thumbnails of the different products available. A user can click on a thumbnail to see a larger image of the product. 
A user can select the size and colour of the shoes and the number of pairs they wish to purchase. The order summery and final price will automaticaly update when changes are made.
When a user hovers over the heart a button appears for them to add the item to their favourites.
This is a sing page website which uses media queries to make it responsive. 
To style the webpage I used the CSS framework SASS.
